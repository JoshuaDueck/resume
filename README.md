# Resume

## Purpose
It is critical that software develpers looking for jobs host an up-to-date, easily-readable resume. In this README, we will look at a very easy approach to hosting a resume on GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites
* A Markdown-formatted resume. See this great [GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) on Markdown syntax.
* A GitHub account.

## How to Host a Resume Repository on GitHub Pages
Setting up a basic repository to host a resume on GitHub Pages is simple, and requires only very basic knowledge of Markdown, Jekyll, and Git. Markdown is a light-weight text format that allows usersto write plain-text files with special notation, that can easily be converted into HTML to be styled and displayed in a browser. Jekyll is a tool that is used to 

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Create a resume in Markdown, called index.md.
3. Enable GitHub Pages on that repository.
4. Add a theme.

## FAQs
> Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

Since Markdown is stored as a plain-text file, it is extremely portable and can be human-readable without any proprietary program, so long as you have a text-editor or viewer. Furthermore, since markdown uses simple in-text notation to imply structure and formatting, many different styles can be easily applied over-top of Markdown files .

> Q: Why is my resume not showing up?

It often takes a few minutes before GitHub Pages can build and deploy a new version of your website after you push a commit. You can view the current status of your most recent deployment via the deployment page for your website repository: www.github.com/[your username]/[repository name]/deployments/.

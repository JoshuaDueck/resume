## FAQs
**Q: Why is Markdown better than a word processor?**
A: Since Markdown is stored as a plain-text file, it is extremely portable and can be human-readable without any proprietary program, so long as you have a text-editor or viewer. Furthermore, since markdown uses simple in-text notation to imply structure and formatting, many different styles can be easily applied over-top of Markdown files .
